# Installation and setup

I installed the k-wave toolbox from http://www.k-wave.org/index.php and it was really
easy. The only part that didn't work was seeing the examples in the help panel, but
it was no problem because I could browse to them in the k-wave folder I copied to the
Matlab directory (there may be problemas with permissions if the k-wave directory is in
a protected directory, but I only had to copy the files to another directory with the 
correct permissions)

# Examples from http://www.k-wave.org/documentation/k-wave.php

My first step to work with k-wave was to run some of the examples from the link 
above. To run the examples faster, I recommend installing the Parallel Computing Toolbox if you
have a PC with a graphics card because the speed up is big. However, some examples had trouble
running with the GPU option enabled, so I had to default to the simpler CPU only option.
